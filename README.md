Discord BOT with Slash Commands setup for Dolphin

This is a basic bot for Discord that was set up for Manta Network to support queries from users regarding the Dolphin Testnet.

It relies on a simple switch statement infrastructure (which divides questions into categories) and a string builder, 
and is interacted with ephemeral slash commands
